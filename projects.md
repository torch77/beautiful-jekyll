## NYC Transportation Trend Shiny Dashboard
A while back I was interested in seeing how transportation trends were changing in New York City with the introduction of new modes of transit such as bike share and transportation network companies (e.g. Uber, Lyft). I put this dashboard together using publicly available trip data to see changes in trip trends over time by neighborhood. In the future, I'd like to update the dashboard and write a blog post about some of the interesting things it reveals. In the meantime, feel free to [check it out](https://torch77.shinyapps.io/transpo_app_v2/) for yourself and see what, if anything, you find interesting. Just be aware that it is hosted on a free shinyapps server so it may take a minute to spin up.
