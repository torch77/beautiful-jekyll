I'm interested in how data, and the analysis of said data, can improve the functioning of cities and the transportation systems which serve them. Currently, I work in the analytics department at Motivate, which operates some of the U.S.'s largest bike share systems (e.g. New York City's Citi Bike). Previously, I've worked in research positions at Regional Plan Association in New York and Carnegie Mellon University's Traffic21 Research Center. While at RPA, I developed a transportation demand model for the Fourth Regional Plan which was used to assess the effect of proposed policy changes and infrastructure projects on regional mobility. At CMU, I contributed to the creation of performance metrics to evaluate the Pittsburgh bus system using archive vehicle location data. Feel free to check out my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacksonwhitmore/) for more details regarding my work and education. 

Outside of transportation and analytics, I enjoy travelling and exploring new cities, reading, and following New York sports (Yankees, Giants, Rangers, Knicks).
